  minimal (authentication & payments included, but few extras). Great for indie
  hackers & small teams who want modern Next.js 13 patterns out-of-the-box.
pros:
  - Highly popular & community-vetted (15k+ stars); official Next.js conventions; type-safe and minimal design makes it easy to understand and customize
  - Integrates essential SaaS needs without heavy complexity. 20+ contributors with strong community support
cons:
  - Being minimal, it omits advanced features (no built-in admin panel, RBAC, file storage)
  - No social login by default (email/pass only)
  - Uses Drizzle instead of Prisma
  - Stripe integration is basic (checkout + webhook) - no subscription management UI
community: |
  Active discussions on Reddit (r/nextjs) and GitHub. No dedicated Discord, but
  Next.js community channels serve as support.
