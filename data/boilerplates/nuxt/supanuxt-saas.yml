  - "**TRPC implementation** in Nuxt ecosystem for end-to-end type safety (bringing tRPC to Vue)"
  - Multi-Tenancy (Teams) support

use_case: |
  If you prefer Vue/Nuxt over React or Svelte, this is one of the few robust
  open SaaS starters. Good for small SaaS projects, especially those involving
  AI (given OpenAI integration). Developers comfortable with Vue find this a
  quicker starting point than learning Next.js starters. Interesting for those
  who want to experiment with tRPC in a Vue environment.
pros:
  - Fills a gap for Vue - there are many Next.js starters, but fewer Nuxt ones. 500+ stars shows demand
  - Nuxt 3 brings SSR and structure similar to Next with Vue's approachable syntax
  - Integration with Supabase means no custom auth or basic CRUD backend coding needed
  - Pinia provides simple global store for managing user and team state
  - Uses Vue composition API best practices
cons:
  - Not as battle-tested as some others. tRPC with Nuxt is less common, meaning less community knowledge for specific issues
  - Supabase does heavy lifting - any limitations there affect your app
  - Feature set might not be as extensive yet (no audit logs or complex role support without custom work)
  - Vue's ecosystem for SaaS-specific components is smaller than React's
community: |
  Listed on SaaS starters sites, author participates in Supabase and Vue
  communities. Vue/Nuxt developers helpful on forums; Nuxt Discord or GitHub for
  guidance. Supabase Discord has #vue channel for integration questions.
deployment:
  - Vercel
  - Netlify
  - Supabase
