key_features:
  - Full-stack SaaS template emphasizing multi-tenancy and workspaces
  - User authentication with JWT sessions or NextAuth
  - Teams & workspaces (users can belong to multiple workspaces)
  - Multi-tenant structure (each workspace data is isolated; includes custom domains for each tenant)
  - Subscription billing and Stripe integration for paid plans
  - Built-in landing page and pricing page for marketing site
  - Basic email sending via Nodemailer (for welcomes, etc.)
  - SEO optimizations and simple blog
  - ESLint/Prettier and VSCode config included
  - One-click deploy to Vercel with instructions
use_case: |
  Good for founders building B2B SaaS where each customer has their own
  workspace or subdomain. Middle-ground - more features than minimal Next.js
  starter, but lighter than BoxyHQ's enterprise kit. If you want multi-tenancy
  with custom domains, basic billing, and pre-built landing site in one package.
  Structure is also educational for Next.js monorepo with shared code between
  app and marketing site.
pros:
  - Covers multi-tenancy cleanly (workspace model with role-based access)
  - Has Stripe subscription flow built-in
  - "Community-driven with positive reviews (Vercel's Steven Tey praised it: \"super helpful for folks to bootstrap their MVPs\")"
  - Documentation site provided, includes custom domain configuration examples - rare and useful for SaaS
  - MIT licensed and free for commercial use
  - README showcases live SaaS products built on Nextacular
cons:
  - At 1.3k stars, community is smaller - support exists but not as large as others
  - Some features require manual setup (email needs SMTP configured; custom domains require DNS setup)
  - Relatively new, expect occasional bugs or need to update for latest Next versions
  - Lacks very advanced features like SSO or SCIM (integrate those if needed)
  - Integrates many pieces (auth, Stripe), understanding full codebase takes time for newcomers
