use_case: |
  Perfect for those who want a solid foundation without extra cruft. If you
  value developer experience and type safety, T3 is ideal - many indie SaaS
  projects start with T3 Stack. Ideal for small teams/startups who plan to build
  out features themselves but want authentication and a robust structure
  pre-set. Also a great learning tool with lots of tutorials and community help.
pros:
  - Maximum flexibility, only use what you need, excellent documentation
  - Extremely popular & well-supported with huge Discord community
  - The type-safe end-to-end approach means fewer runtime errors
  - Very flexible - you opt into only what you need (can exclude NextAuth or Prisma)
  - Regular updates with new Next.js and library versions
cons:
  - No payments/email built-in, requires manual SaaS feature additions
  - Focuses on dev-stack rather than features
  - Reliance on tRPC and NextAuth means a learning curve if unfamiliar
  - Because it's minimal, you'll spend time adding UI components
  - Not a turnkey SaaS solution, but a high-quality starting scaffold
community: |
  Active Discord (~30k members), weekly community calls, and many contributors.
  Lots of content (blogs, YouTube) about building with T3, plus community
  support for common issues. Regular improvements keep pace with new Next.js
  app directory features.
