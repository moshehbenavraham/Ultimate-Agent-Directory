use_case: |
  Ideal for teams who want a Rails-like developer experience in JavaScript.
  Great for SaaS or applications that benefit from GraphQL with lots of
  structure and tooling. Especially good for startups that need to scale -
  architecture is scalable (API and Web separate, can be scaled independently).
  Shines in CRUD-heavy apps, marketplaces, or internal tools.
pros:
  - Complete end-to-end framework - front-end and back-end in one package with consistent development approach
  - Generators and CLI significantly speed up development (scaffold pages, layouts, CRUD for models)
  - GraphQL API with services provides clean separation and built-in security
  - Thriving community and detailed documentation including tutorials
  - Encourages good practices (type safety, test coverage, storybook)
  - Active community and steady releases with 250+ contributors
cons:
  - Heavyweight & opinionated - must embrace Redwood's way (file structure, GraphQL)
  - If unfamiliar with GraphQL or don't need it, may feel complex
  - Learning curve for Redwood conventions (Cells, Routes, Services)
  - Bundle size larger due to GraphQL client
  - Debugging across GraphQL boundary adds complexity vs tRPC
  - Auth requires configuration for providers
  - Newer paradigm - fewer developers know it compared to plain Next.js, so hiring/training considerations
community: |
  Very active - forums on community.redwoodjs.com where core devs answer
  questions, Discord server, weekly "Redwood Office Hours" chats. Many startups
  building on Redwood (some raised funding). GitHub repo has 250+ contributors

  videos). Community explicitly welcoming to newcomers with Contributor's guide.
