name: Wave (The DevDojo)

description: |
  Less of a boilerplate and more of a "SaaS-in-a-Box." Provides a fully
  functional application that requires customization rather than construction.
  Complete "SaaS in a box" for Laravel, arguably the most feature-complete
  starter in any language.

github_repo: thedevdojo/wave
github_stars: 6400
license: MIT
technical_stack:
  - component: Frontend
    technology: Blade + Tailwind + Alpine.js
    reasoning: |
      The "TALL" stack offers high interactivity with low JS complexity
  - component: Backend
    technology: Laravel 10 (PHP framework)
    reasoning: Mature, robust framework with immense ecosystem support
  - component: Database
    technology: MySQL / PostgreSQL
    reasoning: Standard, reliable relational storage (Eloquent ORM)
  - component: Auth
    technology: Laravel Sanctum (API) + Session (web)
    reasoning: DevDojo Auth (Native), deeply integrated
key_features:
  - User registration with email verification, login, profile management
  - Fully functional Voyager Admin Panel (BREAD operations GUI) for managing users, posts, pages, and running custom CRUD
  - "Subscription billing: plans & payments via Stripe or Paddle (with trials, tier limits)"
  - Teams/Organizations (Wave v1.5 added team accounts support)
  - "Roles & permissions: define roles (admin, user, etc.) and gate content"
  - Production-ready Subscription Architecture (plan management, user impersonation, automated invoicing via Stripe)
  - Notifications system (users get notifications via on-site bell icon)
  - Ready-to-use API with Sanctum tokens (serve JS front-end or mobile app)
  - "Blog and page builder: create blog posts or site pages via admin (useful for marketing content)"
  - "User impersonation: Admins can log in as other users to assist them"
  - "\"Themes\" system for swapping UI skins (DevDojo offers some plugins)"
  - Modular plugin system for extending features
  - Beautiful UI for landing page and dashboard
use_case: |
  Best for PHP/Laravel developers who want a huge head start. Building a SaaS
  that needs user management, subscriptions, admin dashboards - Wave gives you
  that to immediately start adding domain-specific features. Perfect for
  membership sites, content SaaS, or products where users login and pay for
  premium features. Good if you want combined CMS + SaaS (Voyager admin can
  manage content).
pros:
  - All-inclusive - arguably the most feature-complete starter in any language
  - Polished UI and tons of functionality (user avatars, API tokens UI, etc.)
  - Laravel's strength in authentication and billing (via Cashier) shines
  - "Rapid setup: SaaS with logins, subscriptions, and blog by just configuring .env settings and running migrations"
  - Active maintenance by DevDojo (founder created Wave for community)
  - Theming ability for customizing look & feel. 1k+ forks on GitHub
cons:
  - With so many features, learning curve is real - need to understand Laravel and Voyager admin to customize effectively
  - Can feel bloated if you don't need everything (e.g., blog or marketing site)
  - Voyager admin has its own patterns that not every Laravel dev likes
  - Being PHP, real-time features (notifications currently on-page only) might need Pusher or Echo setup
  - Default front-end uses Blade and jQuery for some interactions; integrating modern Vue or React requires manual work
  - Long-term support tied to DevDojo (though it's open source, community could fork)
community: |
  DevDojo has dedicated Wave community - forums where users ask questions,
  share how they built on Wave. GitHub repo active with 1k+ forks. DevDojo's
  founder Tony engages often. Many YouTube videos and tutorials on using Wave
  (has been around for years). Wave's popularity in Laravel circles is high -
  often recommended as starting point for new SaaS apps. Many have launched
  startups on Wave, attesting to robustness. ---
