use_case: Perfect for those who want a solid foundation without extra cruft. If you value developer experience and type safety, T3 is ideal. Many indie SaaS projects start with T3 Stack. Ideal for small teams and startups who plan to build out features themselves but want authentication and a robust structure pre-set.

pros:
  - Maximum flexibility with opt-in modules
  - Excellent documentation at create.t3.gg
  - Extremely popular and well-supported

  - Type-safe end-to-end means fewer runtime errors
  - Maintainers keep it updated with new Next.js versions

cons:
  - No payments or email built-in
  - Requires manual SaaS feature additions
  - Learning curve for tRPC and NextAuth
  - Minimal UI requires adding components

community: Active Discord with 30k+ members, weekly community calls, many contributors. T3 Axiom and other forks extend it. Lots of content including blogs and YouTube tutorials.
