  Best free complete SaaS starter. Represents a shift towards
  "configuration-as-code" frameworks. Built on Wasp, a distinct DSL (Domain
  Specific Language) that compiles to a React/Node.js/Prisma stack.
  "Batteries-included" starter covering nearly every SaaS requirement
  out-of-box.

use_case: |
  Perfect for founders who want a "complete" SaaS boilerplate covering all
  standard features - "superstack" approach. If you want to launch a product
  quickly with minimal coding of common features (auth, billing, etc.), OpenSaaS
  is ideal. Great if you appreciate end-to-end type safety and are open to using
  the Wasp framework.
pros:
  - Incredibly feature-rich (covers nearly every SaaS requirement out-of-box) - saves months of dev time
  - Strong type-safety and developer experience via Wasp (auto-generates types for front/back)
  - Active development and large contributor base (50+ contributors)
  - Strong community and Discord support
  - Excellent docs and update mechanism to pull new template changes
cons:
  - Highly opinionated - tied to Wasp DSL, which adds a learning curve (developers must learn Wasp syntax and conventions)
  - Less flexible if you need custom architecture - stepping outside Wasp's abstractions may be tricky
  - Breadth of features means more complexity - initial setup/config is heavier
  - Requires comfort with full-stack JS and DevOps (to manage keys for Stripe, S3, etc.)
  - Wasp is newer than plain Next.js, so smaller ecosystem
community: |
  Active Discord community with GitHub discussions and frequent releases. Many
  blog posts and Product Hunt discussions reference it. Comprehensive docs at
  opensaas.sh.
