use_case: |
  Perfect if you prefer Svelte's reactivity and simplicity over React. Great
  way to start a SaaS with smaller bundle size and simpler state management.
  Ideal for solo devs or small teams who want an all-in-one starter with
  marketing and app combined, and are comfortable using a BaaS (Supabase). Also
  suitable for learning SvelteKit + Supabase integration.
pros:
  - Very feature-rich for a Svelte starter - few templates include this breadth (marketing site, auth, billing)
  - Clean and modern UI (Tailwind + prebuilt components)
  - SvelteKit offers excellent performance
  - Using Supabase means less server code (focus on client logic)
  - Solid following (2k+ stars) indicating it solved a need in Svelte community
  - TypeScript support ensures type safety
  - Follows SvelteKit best practices
cons:
  - Supabase lock-in - moving off it to self-host Postgres requires effort
  - SvelteKit has smaller ecosystem than React/Next - fewer ready-made packages
  - If team is unfamiliar with Svelte, that's a learning curve (though many find Svelte easier than React)
  - May not have enterprise features like SAML SSO or elaborate RBAC - those would be custom add-ons
community: |
  Svelte community is enthusiastic; starter shared on Svelte Discords and
  "Awesome SvelteKit" lists. Author Scott (scosman) engages with GitHub issues
  and updates for new SvelteKit versions. Supabase has growing Svelte user base
  with support in Supabase forums.

  - Vercel
