key_features:
  - "**Automatic Client Generation**: Uses OpenAPI (Swagger) spec to automatically build TypeScript client, ensuring frontend types are always in sync with backend Pydantic models"
  - "Production-ready out-of-the-box: user registration & login with JWT auth (and refresh tokens)"
  - Secure password reset via email (integrated with SMTP)
  - Role-based security (users vs superusers)
  - Example CRUD for items (with React components and API calls)
  - Highly optimized Docker Compose setup with Traefik as reverse proxy/load balancer
  - Automatic HTTPS with Traefik and Let's Encrypt for Docker deploys
  - Supports multi-container cloud deployment - one command stands up Postgres, backend, frontend, proxy by reading .env files
  - Async support
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD configured
  - Copier-based generation (cookiecutter to generate new code with same pattern)
use_case: |
  Ideal for Python enthusiasts building a SaaS or web app who want a robust
  starting point. Especially useful in organizations preferring Python for
  business logic (data science, etc.) with snappy JS front-end. Top choice for
  learning: demonstrates well-structured FastAPI project and React SPA
  integration. Many production services built on it.
pros:
  - Extremely well-architected by FastAPI's author - follows best practices for security (JWT auth with refresh, hashed passwords), API design, and DevOps (Dockerization)
  - "Feature completeness: user management, CRUD patterns, tests, background tasks"
  - Popularity (40k stars) means lots of community support - Q&A on GitHub and third-party articles
  - Type hints everywhere (FastAPI's strength) with Pydantic/SQLModel for data validation
  - Template can be generated via Cookiecutter or GitHub template
cons:
  - Heavy on Docker and config - initial learning curve if unfamiliar with containers or JWT auth flows
  - Assumes DevOps knowledge (e.g., Traefik configuration)
  - React front-end is fairly basic (no sophisticated state management by default)
  - If you prefer all-Python stack (Django templating), this is more complex with two languages
  - While JWT is flexible, some prefer session/cookie auth (requires adjustments for SSR apps)
  - Updates from template must be manually merged into your project
community: |
  Huge - FastAPI community uses this template extensively. Discussions on
  whether people use it in production (many do). Issues answered by community
  and sometimes Sebastin himself. Referenced in conference talks and tutorials.
  Ask questions on FastAPI's Discord/Stack Overflow with high chance of answers
  from template users. Cookiecutter has been forked and customized by many
  (different frontends or ORMs). #### FastAPI + Other Frontends
