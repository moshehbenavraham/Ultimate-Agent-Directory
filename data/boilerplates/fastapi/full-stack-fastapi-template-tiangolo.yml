key_features:
  - "**Automatic Client Generation**: Uses OpenAPI (Swagger) spec to automatically build TypeScript client, ensuring frontend types are always in sync with backend Pydantic models"
  - "Production-ready out-of-the-box: user registration & login with JWT auth (and refresh tokens)"
  - Secure password reset via email (integrated with SMTP)
  - Role-based security (users vs superusers)
  - Example CRUD for items (with React components and API calls)
  - Highly optimized Docker Compose setup with Traefik as reverse proxy/load balancer
  - Automatic HTTPS with Traefik and Let's Encrypt for Docker deploys
  - Supports multi-container cloud deployment - one command stands up Postgres, backend, frontend, proxy by reading .env files
  - Async support
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD configured
  - Copier-based generation (cookiecutter to generate new code with same pattern)
use_case: |
  Ideal for Python enthusiasts building a SaaS or web app who want a robust
  starting point. Especially useful in organizations preferring Python for
  business logic (data science, etc.) with snappy JS front-end. Top choice for
  learning: demonstrates well-structured FastAPI project and React SPA
  integration. Many production services built on it.
pros:
  - Extremely well-architected and follows best practices for security (JWT auth with refresh, hashed passwords), API design, and DevOps (Dockerization)
  - "Feature completeness: user management, CRUD patterns, tests, background tasks"
  - Popularity (40k stars) means lots of community support - Q&A on GitHub and third-party articles
  - Type hints everywhere (FastAPI's strength) with Pydantic/SQLModel for data validation
  - Template can be generated via Cookiecutter or GitHub template
cons:
  - Heavy on Docker and config - initial learning curve if unfamiliar with containers or JWT auth flows
  - Assumes DevOps knowledge (e.g., Traefik configuration)
  - React front-end is fairly basic (no sophisticated state management by default)
  - If you prefer all-Python stack (Django templating), this is more complex with two languages
  - While JWT is flexible, some prefer session/cookie auth (requires adjustments for SSR apps)
  - Updates from template must be manually merged into your project
