key_features:
  - Multi-tenant architecture example with custom subdomain routing via Next.js Middleware
  - Per-tenant content and branding (even emoji logos)
  - Base Admin interface for managing tenants
  - Local dev support for wildcard subdomains
  - Simplified data layer using Redis (each tenant's data stored by subdomain key)
  - Next.js best practices (App Router, Server Components)
  - Production-ready for deployment on Vercel with wildcard domain support
use_case: |
  Ideal for multi-tenant SaaS (e.g., franchise or B2B SaaS where each customer
  has their own subdomain and isolated content). Reference implementation for
  subdomain routing in Next - great for learning multi-tenancy patterns or as
  starting point for platforms like Shopify that require tenant separation.
pros:
  - Official Vercel example - well-architected and up-to-date with latest Next.js features
  - Simplifies complex problem (multi-tenancy) into working template - saves time implementing routing, wildcard domain config
  - Lightweight and framework-idiomatic (no heavy additional libraries)
  - Good DX with TypeScript and Admin UI to see tenants
cons:
  - Focuses narrowly on multi-tenancy - lacks many SaaS essentials (no built-in auth, no database beyond Redis for demo, no billing integration)
  - Meant to be extended, not a full SaaS out-of-box
  - If your app needs relational data or complex backend logic, you'll need to integrate those (swap Redis for Postgres/Prisma)
  - Somewhat Vercel-specific deployment (though adaptable)
community: |
  Backed by Vercel - issues get attention from Vercel engineers. Active user
  base since many Next.js developers fork it to implement multi-tenant setups.
  Discussed in Next.js community forums and adapted in blog tutorials
  (multi-tenancy is a common question). Questions often appear on Reddit
  referencing this kit.
