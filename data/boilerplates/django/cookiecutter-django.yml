key_features:
  - "**100% starting test coverage** (ships with tests to ensure template was generated correctly)"
  - Secure by default (SSL redirect, secure cookies)
  - Docker + Traefik deployment with Let's Encrypt SSL
  - Multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP)
  - Multiple email services
  - "Highly configurable via prompts at creation (choose options: \"use Celery?\", \"use Docker?\", \"DB: Postgres/MySQL?\")"
  - Optional Celery/DRF/Sentry/Heroku
  - Pre-commit hooks (Black, Flake8)
  - User authentication flows with email confirmation via allauth
  - Robust settings management for multiple environments
  - Role-based user groups examples (social auth groups)
use_case: |
  Ideal for Django developers starting a SaaS or web product who want all best
  practices pre-configured. Great for content-heavy SaaS (Django admin for
  content management) or when you need multi-environment settings and Celery
  tasks. Perfect if you deploy on Docker or Heroku and want a reliable setup.
  Doesn't include SaaS billing or teams specifically, but can integrate Stripe
  fairly easily on this solid base.
pros:
  - Mature and battle-tested - has been around for years, each new Django release supported quickly
  - "Embodies ton of community knowledge: email config, static file storage, CI done in robust way"
  - Highly customizable at creation - pick only what you need (skip Docker or Celery if not needed)
  - Excellent documentation and ecosystem of recipes
  - Security is a priority (SSL, secure settings defaults)
  - Django's built-in admin and allauth means admin panel and user auth ready on day one - huge time saver. 250+ contributors over time
cons:
  - More of a backend starter - frontend is server-rendered Django with Bootstrap (for fancy reactive frontend, build that or integrate JS framework separately)
  - Multitude of options can be overwhelming for beginners
  - Docker usage might be overkill for simple projects (but can disable it)
  - One-time project generator - won't easily pull in upstream updates, maintain your project as Django evolves
