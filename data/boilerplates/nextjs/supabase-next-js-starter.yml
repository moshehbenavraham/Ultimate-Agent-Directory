use_case: |
  Great for developers who want to move fast by outsourcing backend complexity
  to Supabase. If you prefer not to manage your own database or auth service,
  this gives you a SaaS scaffold with minimal DevOps. Good example of
  integrating Next.js with popular Supabase stack (which many startups use).
  Ideal for MVPs and small SaaS where using a BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) is
  acceptable.
pros:
  - Very developer-friendly - using Supabase means a lot of functionality (auth, DB, storage) is ready out-of-the-box with nice UI (Supabase Studio) to manage data
  - Praised for high code quality and a polished SaaS feature set
  - "Good use of modern libraries: tRPC for type-safe API, Tailwind + Radix UI for sleek design"
  - Fairly lightweight - no custom server components beyond Next API routes for Stripe webhooks
  - Community-supported with active discussions on Reddit and GitHub
cons:
  - Ties you to Supabase - while Supabase is open source, moving off it (to self-host Postgres) requires effort
  - Must be comfortable with Supabase Auth constraints (magic link flows, etc.)
  - Might not include advanced enterprise features (no SAML SSO, roles beyond basic admin/member out of the box)
  - Smaller community (hundreds of stars, not thousands yet), though growing
  - Supabase is evolving, so keep template updated with any Supabase API changes
