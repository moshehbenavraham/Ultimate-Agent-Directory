technical_stack:
  - component: Frontend
    technology: Next.js 16+ (App Router)
    reasoning: Leverages React Server Components for performance
  - component: Styling
    technology: Tailwind CSS 4
    reasoning: |
      Standard for utility-first styling; v4 brings performance gains
  - component: Backend
    technology: Next.js Server Actions
    reasoning: |
      Eliminates the need for a separate API layer for many CRUD tasks
  - component: Database
    technology: Drizzle ORM
    reasoning: |
      Lighter and faster than Prisma; SQL-like syntax appeals to purists
  - component: Auth
    technology: Clerk
    reasoning: |
      Outsourced auth reduces maintenance burden for MFA/Social login
  - component: Env Management
    technology: T3 Env
    reasoning: Enforces type safety for environment variables at build time
key_features:
