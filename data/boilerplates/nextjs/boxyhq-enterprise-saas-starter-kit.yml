use_case: |
  Best for startups targeting enterprise customers - if you need SSO
  (SAML/OIDC), team management, audit trails from day one. Great for launching a
  production-grade SaaS with minimal custom auth coding, especially if selling
  to orgs with compliance needs (SSO, SCIM user provisioning).
pros:
  - Feature-complete for multi-tenant SaaS - covers rarely-included features like SAML SSO, SCIM directory sync, audit logs
  - Solid architecture using Next.js and Prisma (familiar stack)
  - Active maintenance by BoxyHQ with frequent releases and quick issue resolution
  - Good docs and Discord for community support
  - UI is clean (Tabler + Tailwind)
  - Highly modular - turn features on/off as needed. ~40 contributors
cons:
  - Breadth of features adds complexity - initial setup involves many env variables
  - Some features (billing) labeled "coming soon." If your SaaS is simple (just email auth), might be overkill
  - Uses Pages Router (not App Router)
  - Apache 2.0 license requires attribution
